Cast  for  Fish


In a nearby thornbush, you found a stick that
can serve as a fishing rod – just tie a length
of your Magical Unbreakable Fishing Line
to the end.

That leaves the hook and bait.
Fortunately, the thorns can provide
a few years's worth of makeshift
hooks, and a surprising amout of burrowing
worms squirm around in the sand.


Fish provide Food, and sometimes Magic.

Cast  Dice
cube magic

Enchanting arbitrary cube-shaped objects
to award random rewards is technically
a level three spell, but any serious
party magician learns it way, way early.

Iactā!


Casting 1 die consumes 1 Magic
and may yield Magic and/or Food.

Cast  Iron
magic magic

Your Fireball is most likely hot enough
to melt metallic lumps that line the mountain.

To get a usable shape, you'll need a mold;
perhaps your Hypnotic Cards can persuade
one of the local tiny sandworms to burrow
in just the right way.



Casting Iron requires 2 Magic
and yields an Item.

Cast  a  Shadow
thing

By putting Items on a rocky ledge, you should
be able to cast some nifty shadows on the wall.

Maybe you can even spell out a message?

...
You suddenly remember the four runes
traditionally used for distress signals:
H E L P


You need Items to cast shadows.

Cast  Arcane Missile
magic ×30

Deals 3d6 Arcane damage to target opponent,
and may Stun for 1d4 turns.

Perhaps today's world is too civilized
for battle magic, but hey – this would be
quite something to brag about, if you can
pull it off!


Magic Missile is a pretty advanced spell.
At your level, it'll cost 30 Magic.

Combined with a suitable message,
it might attract someone's attention.
